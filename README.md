Happy Birthday, Ross, I love you!
This project allows users to roll 2 D10 dice to get a percentile number. On desktop, the number is read aloud. On mobile, the number is read aloud when a screen reader is enabled. The dice have illustrations of Dixie, drawn by Jan√®t Raymond, Jack Stassi, Thomas Feirstein, Hunter, and Sterling.
